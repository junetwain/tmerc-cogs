Use of this cog, _even once_, could get your bot quarantined or permanently banned. Remember, any servers which your bot is in, _even ones that you yourself are not_, can use this cog and get your bot banned. If you are not willing to take this risk, please uninstall this cog right now. If you choose to use it anyway and it results in action taken against you or your bot, I (tmerc) take no responsibility. **You have been warned!**",
